# Description:      Series of random unit tests to test a function called
#                   credit_card_validator that is passed a sequence of digits
#                   as a string that represents a credit card number. This
#                   function will return True if it is a valid credit card
#                   number, otherwise, it will return False. Limits are the
#                   same as assignment for HW1. There are 5 bugs in total.
