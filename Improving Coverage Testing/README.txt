# Description:      Series of unit tests to test a function called
#                   contrived_func that is passed a numerical value
#                   and will test either true or false depending on the
#                   conditional statement, and must have a case for each
#                   combination of conditions. There must only be 7 test
#                   cases, and only one assert for each case. The cases
#                   must find C1 through C12, and contain no linting errors.
